# Orion sample AI task - single GPU - word2vec #


# Introduction #

This is a sample AI script for testing task-processing pipeline on Nebula AI Orion working node.
Original article: https://medium.com/deep-math-machine-learning-ai/chapter-9-2-nlp-code-for-word2vec-neural-network-tensorflow-544db99f5334

# Model Description #

A basic word2vec model which:

-  Download text files from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip, load into directory _datadir_.
-  Generate a training batch for skip-gram model.
-  Build and train skip-gram model.
-  Create embedding visualization plot.

# Results #

Results of this model include:

- Checkpoints for tensorboard visualization. 
- A figure showing a subset of first 250 words in vector place. Words that are similar end up clustering nearby each other.

# Remarks # 

- The entire task-processing time (20000 steps) on Orion platform takes around 2 minutes.
- Nebula AI working node will execute the file "word2vec_basic.py", and save all results in the directory _log_, 
- Users will be able to retrieve contents from result directory, together with system execution log.
- For more details on how-to-guides for task submission, please refer to instructions on Nebula AI developer portal.
